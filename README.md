# Matozu

The name derives from the japanese words for marker and map:
mato = Target, Marker + chizu = map (zu = image)


# What it does

This project makes it easy to place and name markers on a map.

Soon coming will be the feature to generate a simple share URL to send it to
other people. For now it just generates a JSON Object for you, that you can
simply copy and place it directly into the index.htm file or separately into the
data directory.
